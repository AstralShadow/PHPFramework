# PHPFramework (in development)
My own php framework with minimal ORM and REST-capabilites.
Currently not actively developed, but should be in a working state so far.

This requires PHP 8.0


# How to use.

Check the [wiki](https://github.com/AstralShadow/PHPFramework/wiki).

You should make the following directories inside your project:
* Core - clone of this repository
* Templates - contains html files that will be used as http responses. Hard-coded in Template.php
* Resources - images or other files you want to include from the templates.

The project includes an autoloader script, so keep your names and namespaces consistent.

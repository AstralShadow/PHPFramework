# PHPFramework (in development)
My own php framework with minimal ORM and REST-capabilites.
Currently not actively developed, but should be in a working state so far.

This requires PHP 8.0


# How to use.

You should make the following directories inside your project:
* Core - clone of this repository
* Templates - contains html files that will be used as http responses. Hard-coded in Template.php
* Resources - images or other files you want to include from the templates.

The project includes an autoloader script, so keep your names and namespaces consistent.

The project still lacks a wiki, but has some phpdocs.
Some of them will be useful if your IDE can process them.
Most of the major IDE-s should have that capability.

# PHPFramework (EXPERIMENTAL, lacks a wiki)
Simple php framework with minimal ORM and REST-capabilites.
I created it for personal use, but will try to make it usable once it looks working.

# How to use that.
You should make the following directories inside your project:
* Core - clone of this repository
* Templates - contains html files that will be used as http responses. Hard-coded in Template.php
* Resources - images or other files you want to include from the templates.

The project includes an autoloader script, so keep your names and namespaces consistent.

To be honest, you shouldn't use it at that stage. Wait for a proper tutorial.
